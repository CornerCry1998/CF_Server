# CF_Server
This is an emulator for crossfire. Actually it's just a base, which you can just login in with an account, join a server and a channel, create a room. The source code still needs to be developed for years i think. But i think it could be useful for anyone who wants to realize how CF packets are going.
For detouring the client and force it connect to your own socket. Take a look here: https://forum.ragezone.com/f858/tutorial-set-semi-crossfire-emulator-1014892/
